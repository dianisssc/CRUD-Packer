# CRUD Packer

 

An application that helps users manage boxes and inventory. Users can input the contents of the box and the application will save that content and generate a barcode with a unique ID. Users can either scan the barcode or input the unique ID in order to see the boxâ€™s contents


# Minimal viable product

1.) Welcome screen has two options, create a box collection, or manage box collection

1.5) When pressing manage box collection, user is prompted for a code and a password

2.) When in the manage box collection screen, it gives you the option to select a box or create a new one. Once you select a box, you can update or delete it.

3.) When creating a box collection, it'll prompt the user for a box collection name and password. It'll then send you to an empty collection, where you can do everything a CRUD app allows.
